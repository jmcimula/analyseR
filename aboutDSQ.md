If you are asked questions like what is your favourite leisure activity? Or something like what is that you like to do for fun?  Most of the people often tend to answer that they like to read programming books or do coding thinking that this is what they are supposed to say in a technical interview. Is this something you really do it for fun? A key point to bear in mind that the interviewer is also a person and interact with them as a person naturally. This will help the interviewer see you as an all-rounder who can visualize the company’s whole vision and not just view business problems from an academic viewpoint.
