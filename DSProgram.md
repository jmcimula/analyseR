#REQUIRED/CORE COURSES:

##ALGORITHMS FOR DATA SCIENCE

Prerequisites: basic knowledge in programming (e.g., at the level of COMS W1007), a basic grounding in calculus and linear algebra.

Methods for organizing data, e.g. hashing, trees, queues, lists,priority queues. Streaming algorithms for computing statistics on the data. 
Sorting and searching. Basic graph models and algorithms for searching, shortest paths, and matching. Dynamic programming. Linear and convex programming. 
Floating point arithmetic, stability of numerical algorithms, Eigenvalues, singular values, PCA, gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and block coordinate descent. 
Conjugate gradient, Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Large scale applications from signal processing, collaborative filtering, recommendations systems, etc.

##PROBABLITY AND STATISTICS

Prerequisite: Calculus.

This course covers the following topics: Fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference used in data science; 
Probabilistic models, random variables, useful distributions, expectations, law of large numbers, central limit theorem; Statistical inference;
point and confidence interval estimation,hypothesis tests, linear regression.

##MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA SCIENCE

Prerequisites: Background in linear algebra and probability and statistics.

An introduction to machine learning, with an emphasis on data science. Topics will include least squares methods, Gaussian distributions, linear classification, 
linear regression,  maximum likelihood, exponential family distributions, Bayesian networks, Bayesian inference, mixture models, the EM algorithm, graphical models, 
hidden Markov models, support vector machines, and kernel methods. Part of the course will be focused on methods and problems relevant to big data problems.
